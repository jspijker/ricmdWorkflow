#ricmdWorklow


R package for registration of audit trails of data products. 

This [R](https://r-project.org) package uses the
[ricmd](https://github.com/jspijker/ricmd) and
[git2r](https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r) package to add project meta
data to data objects in [iRODS](https://irods.org) the integrated Rule
Oriented Data System. The project meta data is based on
information from the git repository and some user provided project
information.

With this package it is possible to create audit trails for data
objects, showing for each object from which script (code) the object
was produced. 

# development status

This package is experimental and under development. Do not
expect a full functional package and do not assume that changes in the
package will be backwards compatible.
